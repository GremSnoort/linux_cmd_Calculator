# linux_cmd_Calculator
simple cmd calc inspired by https://habr.com/ru/company/yandex/blog/206234/

Hello,
this is a simple task from <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/yandex/blog/206234/">Yandex blog on habr</a>.
You have time about 2 hours and a white paper and you then need to implement a good working code.
My first commit on this challenge - simple_calc.cpp.
I've done some improvements in my code and created a simple project for linux/C++11 with Makefile:
make all - build project;
make simple - build first version
